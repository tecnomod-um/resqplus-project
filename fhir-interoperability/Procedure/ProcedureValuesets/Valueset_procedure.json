  "description": "ValueSet containing SNOMED CT codes representing a range of procedures used in the evaluation and management of stroke patients. This collection includes diagnostic imaging procedures (e.g., carotid angiography, non-contrast brain CT, CT angiography with contrast, brain perfusion CT, MRI studies such as cerebrospinal fluid flow imaging, diffusion-weighted MRI, and cerebral perfusion MRI), therapeutic interventions (e.g., arterial thrombectomy and thrombolysis of cerebral artery by intravenous infusion), and screening/assessment procedures (e.g., assessment using the Gugging Swallowing Screen and tonography with water provocation).",
