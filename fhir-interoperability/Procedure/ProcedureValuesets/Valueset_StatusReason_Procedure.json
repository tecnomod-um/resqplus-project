This collection includes codes denoting factors such as uninsured medical expenses, patient transfer to another facility, unavailability of the required drug, as well as qualifiers indicating that the procedure was not needed or that clinical findings (e.g., mild condition, disability, precerebral arterial occlusion) influenced the decision-making. The ValueSet supports consistent documentation of reasons for not performing or modifying a procedure in clinical practice.",
